# Charting Blood Pressure to Support Physician Diagnosis using Excel

Here, we are creating a medical charting system that records a patient's blood pressure (BP) results and simultaniously analyzes the results overtime. This will allow physicians to easily track the patients BP results to see any changes in the patients condition.

With the patient's approval, we collected the data from a patient who undergone coronay artery bypass grafting and mitral valve repair in June 2020. He/She was advised to take, monitor, and record his/her blood pressure results after the surgery was performed. The dataset consists of the patient's blood pressure results from August 2020 to August 2022

The patient recorded their results using a notebook. Data was manually transferred onto a [spreadsheet](https://github.com/christinepugay/bloodpressure/blob/main/bloodpressure_dataset.xlsx).
